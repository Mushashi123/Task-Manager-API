# Task Manager API

- This is a RESTful API.
- It is build by using vanilla node.js without any third party dependencies.
- It helps us perfom CRUD(Create, Read , Update, Delete) of task that we want to do
- No data based has been used
- This project was created to understand node.js in depth instead of adding abstraction layer with express.js
